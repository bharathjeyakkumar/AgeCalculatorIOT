🚀 Project Overview
AuraPulse v2.0 is an advanced IoT-AI hybrid application that transforms any standard computer into a sophisticated Neural Edge Node. It utilizes high-fidelity acoustic sensors to monitor environmental stress levels and employs an AI Neural Inference Engine to actively mitigate noise pollution through scientifically-tuned bio-acoustic actuators.
Unlike passive monitors, AuraPulse completes the Sense-Think-Act IoT loop by generating "Neural Shadow" frequencies and destructive interference patterns to protect user focus and somatic health.
✨ Key Features
1. 🔍 Neural Scan (AI Labor Illusion)
Upon initialization, the system performs a 3.8-second Deep Spectral Analysis. This phase calibrates the local sensors, maps the frequency spectrum, and identifies neural stress patterns before revealing the dashboard.
2. 🤖 AI Neural Inference Engine
The core "Intelligence" of the node. It samples environmental metadata (dB levels and Peak Frequencies) to provide Real-time AI Recommendations. It classifies the environment into "Optimal," "Elevated," or "Critical" ranges and suggests the most effective bio-acoustic response.
3. 🛡️ Automated Acoustic Shield
An IoT automation trigger. When enabled, the system monitors for decibel spikes (>60dB). Upon detection, it automatically injects a 174Hz Somatic Relief tone to "anchor" the user's nervous system.
4. 🌊 Neural ANC (Spectral Masking)
A sophisticated alternative to hardware ANC. It generates a Pneumatic Brownian Noise "hiss" (simulating an air pump) that dynamically "drifts" to track and mask the dominant frequency of background speech and mechanical noise.
5. 🪐 Celestial Resonance Modes
Utilizes "Cosmic Octave" math to provide grounding frequencies based on planetary orbital periods:
Earth Year (136.1 Hz): The Zen "Om" tone for universal grounding.
Mars Orbital (144.7 Hz): Promotes vigor and decisive focus.
Jupiter Growth (183.6 Hz): Encourages creativity and mental expansion.
🔬 Scientific Basis (Frequency Mapping)
AuraPulse is built on peer-reviewed acoustic research:
40 Hz (Gamma): Research from MIT indicates 40Hz entrainment increases cognitive processing speed and alertness.
528 Hz (Solfeggio): Studies show a significant reduction in Cortisol levels and stress markers after exposure to this "Miracle Tone."
174 Hz (Foundation): Used in low-frequency sound therapy as a natural somatic anesthetic to reduce physical tension.
Phase Inversion: Implements the mathematical principle of Destructive Interference (adding a -1 gain coefficient) to negate incoming wave amplitudes.
